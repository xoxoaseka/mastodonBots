"7twenty 7 is ready to move  
You know she packed her bags  
With nothing left to prove  
I thought I didn't care  
Now I'm fallin' through  
Wouldn't you?  
  
Well, it's a long long journey to the other side  
Oh I've been wishin' all night I was on that flight  
And god, you'd better take care of the sweetest eyes  
I hear myself swallowin' the tears I cry  
I hear myself swallowin' the tears I cry  
  
7twenty7 is up in the air  
You know I feel her hands  
On me everywhere  
I thought I didn't care  
Now i'm saying a prayer  
Hey mister, do you know the way  
To salvation square?  
  
It's a long long winter 'til the birds will sing  
Oh I'll be waitin' all night for the phone to ring  
I'm goin' up in smoke and phoney magazines  
Everything is just pieces of my stupid dreams  
Everything is just spieces of my stupid dreams  
  
With the clouds passin' by  
With the clouds passin' by  
It's all right  
  
7twenty7 is close to the sky  
It carries the world  
Between hello and goodbye  
Like the Monday we met  
That disappeared in a breath  
Like the Sunday she left  
Forever smellin' of death  
  
Another jet black night, another drink to go  
Oh I'll be diving my head in the pure white snow  
God, you'd better take care of this gold skinned friend  
Tell me, will I ever see her again  
Tell me, will I ever see her again

"
"Now it's about time I wrote you a letter  
Hey baby it's me for worse or for better  
Got nothing to waste in pace for another lane  
Now last only gain I know all we had  
Has dried like a desert stands from the sand  
Still on my t-shirt and I create a drink  
Of heavenly cool cool rain  
  
And after all you were the greatest  
After all I did my best  
There is nothing to regret big or small  
After all there wasn't a loop hole  
We were found to take the fall  
Life goes on and on and on after all  
  
Now it's about time I said all the story  
You slept into late and missed all the glory  
Get stuck in a dream that finally blurred your brain  
I try to stay same, hey love is a blinded  
Pops up the window but no one will find teardrops on my pillow  
As I race the glass of heavenly cool champagne  
  
Cause after all you were the greatest  
After all I did my best  
There is nothing to regret large or small, oh  
After all we prove any key-hole  
And you'll see we were bounce to fall  
Life goes on and on and on after all  
Life goes on and on and on after all, after all  
  
And after all you were the greatest  
After all I did my best  
There is nothing to regret big or small  
After all there wasn't a loop hole  
We were found to take the fall  
Life goes on and on and on after all  
Life goes on and on and on after all

"Babe  
Come in from the cold  
Put that coat to rest  
Step inside  
Take a deep breath  
And do what you do best  
Yea  
Kick off them shoes  
And leave those city streets  
I do believe  
Love came our way  
Fate did arrange  
For us to meet  
Refrain  
I love when you do  
That hocus pocus to me  
The way that you touch  
You've got the power to heal  
You give me that look  
It's almost unreal  
It's almost unreal  
Hey  
We can't stop the rain  
Let's find a place by the fire  
Sometimes I feel  
Strange as it seems  
You've been in my dreams  
All my life  
It's a crazy world out there  
Let's hope our prayers  
Are in good hands tonight

"
"Time...  
Time...  
Time so close that I can touch you, give me.  
Time so near that I can breathe you, give me.  
Time I don't know why I feel like surrender.  
Chains The feeling of the feelings still remains  
You're much too old to keep on playing games  
I don't know why I feel like surrender.  
And it's a strange feeling,  
strange feeling I feel inside.  
And it's a strange beating strange,  
beating in this heart of mine.  
I got to run, I got to hide.  
Another place, another time... Time  
A chill is slowly rolling down my spine  
And suddenly I lose the grip on time  
the time and the space of time.  
And it's a strange feeling...

"
"Anyone who have a love close to this  
Knows what I'm saying  
Anyone who wants a dream to come true  
Knows how I'm feeling  
All I can think of is you and me  
Doing the things I want to do  
All I imagine is heaven on earth  
I know it's you  
  
Anyone who ever kissed in the rain  
Knows the whole meaning  
Anyone who ever stood in the light  
Needs no explaining  
But everything more or less appears so meaningless  
Blue and cold  
Walking alone through the afternoon traffic  
I miss you so  
  
Anyone who felt like I do  
Anyone who wasn't ready to fall  
Anyone who loved like I do  
Knows it never really happens at all  
It's over when it's over  
What can I do about it  
Now that it's over  
  
Everything more or less is looking so meaningless  
And fades to grey  
Lying awake in an ocean of teardrops  
I float away  
  
Anyone who ever felt like I do  
Anyone who wasn't ready to fall  
Anyone who loved like I do  
Knows it never really happens at all  
It's over when it's over  
What can I do about it  
Now it's all over

"Beautiful things  
Are comin' my way  
Beautiful things  
I want them to stay  
But after a while  
My beautiful things  
Don't seem beautiful at all  
  
Terrible things  
Like when you wake up  
And all of your dreams  
Seem to crack up  
Like things you have done  
Like breakin' my heart  
For you it don't seem  
Terrible at all  
  
Is there someone I can talk to?  
Someone on the line?  
Does anybody want to hear  
What's on my mind?  
  
Beautiful things  
Like leaves on a tree  
Beautiful things  
The sky and the sea  
Since you've been gone  
No beautiful things  
Seem beautiful to me  
  
Is there someone I can talk to?  
Someone out there on the line?  
Does anybody want to hear  
What's on my mind?  
  
Make the grass grow in the garden  
When the rain is passin' by  
Does anybody want to know  
What's on my mind?

"My girl came home to me  
Just the other day acting okay  
I was reading alone  
In my favourite room the TV was on  
  
May I be excused  
For not telling the truth  
  
Cause she's gone  
She said she's better off on her own  
She turned her head  
Much better off on her own  
  
My girl knocked on the door  
To the place I usually refer to as home  
I died surely some tied  
She looked in my eyes  
Small and surprised  
  
And God closed every gates  
The moon fell into the lake  
  
Boy she's gone, adrift  
She's better off on her own  
She closed, then she left  
Much better off on her own  
  
Sitting naked by the window sill  
Watching cars upon the hill  
Am I sleeping? I was dreaming  
For just a moment time stood still  
  
Better off on her own  
Better off on her own  
  
Now she's gone, she said  
She's better off on her own  
She turned her head  
Much better off on her own  
  
She's gone, she sighed  
She's better off on her own  
The tears I cry  
Much better off on her own  
  
My girl came home to me  
Just the other day

"You want the beating of another man's heart.  
You want that face to tear us apart, oh baby.  
You want that love to take you high in the sky.  
I watch you fly with tears in my eyes.  
Now this is the end,  
This is really goodbye...  
Break another heart,  
Find another fool.  
Take another heart,  
Run and treat it cruel.  
Go break another heart into pieces, baby baby.  
Well I don't want to know and I don't want to stay.  
Go cry to someone else, I will walk away.  
Go break another heart into pieces,  
Baby baby... Not mine!  
I hold a woman I don't know anymore.  
I kiss the lips I've kissed a million times before.  
I love that body but it don't feel the same.  
You play the part in another man's game.  
Och baby, baby  
This love is in vain...  
Break another heart...  
Thinking 'bout all of the nights I held you so tight.  
Two young hearts in the heat of the night together,  
Side by side...  
Break another heart...

"Breathe your life.  
  
I've got to come down  
I've been awake for far too long  
My eyes look torn, they were so strong  
I wore the crown, I wrote the song  
Now it's fading  
My heart was open  
Like a window to a summer breeze  
  
I breathed your love,  
I filled my lungs and veins  
And I breathed your love  
Until I felt the pain  
And like rain it slipped away  
  
I tried to find out  
What love was really all about  
Behind the curtain waits the sky  
It's rare I feel enough to cry  
I'm drying up inside  
My life was open  
Like a window to the summer breeze  
  
I breathed your love,  
I filled my lungs and veins  
And I breathed your love  
Until I met the pain and like rain  
It slipped away, just like a little rain.  
  
I breathed your love  
And nothing stayed the same.  
Yes, I breathed your love  
And filled my heart in vain 'cause like rain  
It slipped away, just like rain it swept away.

"Been thinking about you  
Without even trying, I've done it  
There's something about you  
I can't put my finger on it  
Monday was fine and I was on a high  
  
I'm begging you please to ease, allow your feelings to show, oh oh  
You're bringing me down to my kneesw 'cause I love you so  
  
If your love is strong I want to be sure about it  
Oh is it all wrong to go on talking about it?  
  
Oh you thrilled me  
I should be alright but Friday I died when you killed me  
You're bringing me down to my knees, oh oh  
Love me forever or baby, just let it go, oh oh  
  
Monday was fine, yea the hours went by like a summer breeze  
But way down the line you might make up your mind and it's time to freeze  
You're bringing me down to my knees  
I've been thinking about you

"I know her,  
And every notion I get from her  
I wear inside me.  
I know her,  
  
All of the broken leaves of love  
She leaves behind.  
Oh - don't you hide away from the rain.  
Oh - can you tell me the name of this game?  
  
I got to get through to you.  
Behind the door,  
Another wall,  
A lonely cry a call of the wild.  
  
A dancing daze,  
An empty face,  
A crystal high a call of the wild.  
And there is something that sweeps the dark,  
  
A lover's dart,  
The call of a broken heart.  
Wrapped in the night,  
Behind these eyes,  
  
Oh hear the cry,  
A call of the wild.  
I know her  
And in my mind I dream of her,  
  
How she aches without me.  
I know her  
And every heart is a lonely hunter  
When she walks by.  
  
Oh - can you read the hurt in my eyes?  
Oh - don't you leave without saying goodbye.  
I got to get through to you.  
Behind the door,  
  
Another wall

"Hear my call, here and everywhere I've been walking the streets in despair.  
One more fire turns a shade of grey, one more tear is lost in the rain.  
  
And I say that I love you.  
I say that I need you.  
Baby I leave you a sign of desire.  
No shadow will haunt you,  
No heart will desert you,  
No one will hurt you,  
No space or no time.  
  
Got to got you got to got to take your chances on me,  
Like the river will lead the water to the sea,  
Take on me, take your chances on me.  
Don't ever let it be.  
Don't ever let it be.  
  
There's a night when you close your eyes around a dream that shines like the
sun.  
Everyone knows it's beautiful,  
Tell me why you want to dream it alone.  
  
And I say that I love you,  
I say that I need you,  
Baby I leave you the lines in my palm.  
No darkness will get you,  
No heart will desert you,  
Nothing can hurt you or do you any harm.  
  
Got to...

"Can't we leave the world outside  
Just for a while? Just for a while?  
And spend some time, you and I,  
Under this bright glorious sky.  
  
It's been so long since I first saw you,  
But I still love that smile in your eyes.  
  
Yes it's true, right from the start,  
I believed in the church of your heart.  
Yes it's you that made me be part of  
And believe in the church of your heart.  
  
Step inside, lay yourself down  
Just for a while, rest for a while.  
I can hear a thundering sound  
Beating inside when you're around.  
  
It's been so long since I first met you,  
Since we made love, you know how time flies.  
  
Yes it's true, right from the start,  
I believed in the church of your heart.  
Yes it's you that made me be part of  
And believe in the church of your heart.

"Growing up on Cinnamon Street. Everywhere you look there are lots of people to
meet, it's seven o'clock, the breakfast treat. Now the schoolbus is here,
hurry up and grab a seat. All the dreams are tiny ones, another week has just
begun on Cinnamon Street.  
  
There was a girl on Cinnamon Street, the same age as me, we shared the
curiosity. I won her heart 'cause I could play guitar. I promised her heaven
at once and later all the stars. But it all remained the same 'cause things
can never change on Cinnamon Street.  
  
I can hear my heartbeat the very first time we made love, life was a lazy rest
in the sun. Later we went dancing, staying up all night long - playing all our
favourite songs, Cinnamon songs: Oh oh na na na na na.  
  
I say goodbye to Cinnamon Street. Springtime is here and the air is so dry and
sweet. I walk in a cloud, the smell of cinnamon bread, it's in my blood since
the day I was born 'til I wake up... dead. And the sun is smiling gently, a
funny shade of red, Cinnamon Street.  
  
I still feel my heartbeat the very first time we made love, life was a lazy
day in the sun. Later we went dancing, hanging out all night long - singing
all our favourite songs, Cinnamon songs: Oh oh na na na na na na.

"Never looked back on a love affair. i never spent minutes on history, it made

chemistry.  
  
Come back before you leave. i haven't got room for a broken heart. come back
before you leave. you shouldn't go at all, you shouldn't go at all.  
  
So many years and so many nights, i still can recall oh the way that you move
when you dance, do you want to dance? we've had our habits and attitudes, you
make me remember the power when everyt  
S right, please stay the night. cos baby when you get close to me there's
something about you i really need.  
  
Come back before you leave...  
  
Babe, come back before you leave, i'll be the air for you when you breathe,
i'll be the rising sun. close the door, let's make love, all god's angels sing
above into the rising sun.

"Cooper went out late last night  
I heard the slam from her door  
Foggy ways, november daze  
All the white wolves were smiling  
Cooper went out walkin' the clouds  
She left everything in a mess  
""Shut your mouth when you talk to me""  
Her words were always so small  
  
And there's a sound from the telephone  
When can I say she's coming home?  
Leave me the number you're dialing from  
And may I ask who's calling?  
May I ask who's calling?  
  
Cooper went out, 3 o'clock sharp  
I heard the bells from the church  
Someone said they saw a car  
Picking her up by the stations  
Cooper went out and that's all there is  
I'm just no one from next door  
Everything will be alright  
When all the flowers have cried  
  
Then there's a voice on the telephone  
When can I say she's coming home?  
Leave me the number you're dialing from  
And may I ask who's callin'? (who's calling?)  
May I ask who's calling? (who's calling?)  
May I ask who's calling?

Let's make it now and forever  
I want to show it and shout it  
And tell the whole world about it  
  
I thought it never could happen  
I thought you never would see me  
You run a lovin' locomotive  
You make my needs very primitive  
  
The more I get, the more I want from you, of your affection  
When you're around, I'm in control, I feel a complete connection  
  
Hello, hello  
I'm so crazy about you, you know... baby  
Hello, hello, hello  
Yes I'm crazy, so crazy about you  
  
C'mon close your eyes, honey, trust me!  
I want to enjoy your body  
I want to take you much higher  
And play the game of desire  
  
Well I can't hide  
I'm getting hungry for a bite  
I'm blinded by this obsession  
I keep dancing like your possession  
  
I'll wrap my legs all around you I'll show you total devotion  
No need to talk love will speak to you with sweet emotions  
  
Hello, hello  
I'm so crazy about you, you know...baby  
Hello, hello, hello  
Yes I'm crazy, so crazy about you

"I'm a zombie in the moonlight  
I'm sleepin' when it's daylight  
I really should be alright  
But I'm feelin' kinda uptight  
I'm messin' with a neighbour  
Who killed my amp and fender  
He looked to sweet and tender  
It's hard to tell his gender  
Got coffee on the paper  
My dog's an alligator  
I want you now and later

Got a crush got a crush on you

I'm laughin' at the wrong guy  
I'm drivin' on the wrong side  
My brain is gettin' cock-eyed  
The flag is never chequered  
Can't find my f-beat records  
God, give a little lovin'  
The money's in the oven  
Got dead flies in my scotch with ice  
My talents always vaporize  
I want your bird of paradise  
I got a crush got a crush on you  
Got a crush got a crush on you  
  
Crush! Crush! We got a good thing goin' on  
Crush! Crush! Such a good thing goin' on  
  
I'm freezin' in the summer  
I'm sweatin' in the winter  
No middle in the centre  
No colours in the printer  
No treatment at the pharmacy  
No lessons learned from history  
No future in the factory  
No meaning in the poetry  
No changin' in the weather  
No elvis in the leather  
I want you now or never

Got a crush got a crush on you

"Living here without you is not an easy way of life.  
I spend my time without you, I try to make it all worthwhile.  
Standing in a rainfall coming down from the sky.  
Why should I cry over you?  
Why should I cry cry cry over you?  
I keep on thinking about you.  
I've got no private pride to hide.  
I've built my world around you like a call without reply.  
My love has lost direction, she's got the sun in her eyes.  
Why should I cry...  
Hearing your footsteps, loud on my stairs (a-walking...)--living without you.  
Feeling the sweet sweet smell of love in the air (I can feel it...)--living  
without you.  
Kissing the face that I see everywhere but I'm living without you, living  
without.  
Why should I cry cry cry over you?  
Oh, hearing your footsteps, loud on my stairs (a-walking...)--living without  
you.  
Kissing the face that I see everywhere but  
I'm living without you, I'm living without.  
Cry cry cry over you? Why should I cry...  

"
"There's a hidden meaning in everything he says,  
Every close encounter, every kiss, every caress.  
Even the truth has got that bitter taste of a lie.  
Well, I can read his lips but I can't read his mind.  
I can see him dance away now oh oh -- oh oh oh.  
He was one of the kind that seems so hard to find.  
There's a change of weather, now he leaves me far behind.  
That I don't matter to him came as such a surprise.  
Well, I can read his lips, I thought I read his eyes.

"You pack your bag, you take control  
You're moving into my heart and into my soul  
Get out of my way! Get out of my sight!  
I won't be walking on thin ice to get through the night  
Hey where's your work? What's your game?  
I know your business but I don't know your name...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous  
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,  
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat  
You know she's a little bit dangerous  
  
You turn around, so hot and dry,  
You're hiding under a halo, your mouth is alive  
Get out of my way! Get out of my sight!  
I'm not attracted to go-go deeper tonight  
Hey what's your word? What's your game?  
I know your business but I don't know your name...  
  
Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous  
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,

Oh just a little bit dangerous...  
  
Hey what's your word? What's your game?  
I know your business but I don't know your name...

"Before we take off all our clothes and get close together  
Before it gets too serious both of us need to know  
Are we gonna go the whole awy this time?  
This time?  
  
Before all secrets are revealed old scars must heal or wither  
But it's getting very late and I can't wait anymore  
Are we gonna go the whole way this time  
Do you want to go the whole way this time?  
This time?  
  
Do you want to go the whole way now?  
We're taking it easy  
Do you want to go the whole way, Babe?  
Kick it in, kick it in slowly.  
  
Do you want to go the whole way this time?  
Do you want to go the whole way for sure  
Do you want to go the whole way this time?  
This time?  
This time?  
Do ya?

"Anything can happen  
When I wind up alone with you  
Put your finger on the things I like to do  
Well anything can happen  
There's a feel in the air around you  
Commanding parts of me  
I never ever knew  
  
I want your love  
Of flesh and blood  
Hey you!  
This was really meant to be  
It's for sure our destiny  
Making lovers out of friends  
I don't believe in accidents  
  
Anything can happen  
When you hit that electric room in me  
I lose the time, the place and everything I see  
Well anything can happen  
There's nothin' else in the world I'd rather do  
Than to feed the secret dreams  
Hidden in you  
  
You want the love  
Of flesh and blood  
Hey you!

It's for sure our destiny  
Making lovers out of friends

"Dream on  
Yesterday is gone  
And it's clear  
I'll never get out of here  
No dice  
Got something in my eyes  
It might be a tear  
  
She never shoots her gun  
She only keeps it just for fun  
I wanna call her bluff  
But I never get close enough  
Though I love to hear her heartbeat  
  
Dream on  
Yesterday is gone  
And it's clear  
I'll never get out of here  
No dice  
Got something in my eyes  
It might be a tear  
  
Eighteen times today  
I've been wishin' my day away  
And it's hard to say  
If I'm windin' up ok  
But I pray I'll hear her heartbeat  
  
Dream on  
Yesterday is gone  
And outta year  
I'll never get out of here

"Hot summer night.  
The art of make-believe.  
The treasure behind closed doors.  
The hunter behind the trees  
Radiowaves thru the air.  
Can you hear me calling?  
Oh I've been dreaming.  
Dreaming.  
Dreaming of a woman in white.  
The sound from the street.  
The smell of sweet perfume.  
My breath inside of you hits an electric room  
Radiowaves thru the air.  
Can you hear me calling?  
Oh I've been dreaming.  
Dreaming.  
Dreaming of a woman in white.

"Tried to make it little by little  
Tried to make it bit by bit on my own.

Another town where I get close to the bone.

Oh oh oh  
Whatcha gonna tell your father?  
I don't know!  
Whatcha gonna tell your mother?  
Let me go...  
  
I'm gonna get dressed for success  
Shaping me up for the big time, baby.  
Get dressed for success  
Shaping it up for your love yea yea yea.  
  
I'm not afraid  
A trembling flower  
I'll feed your heart  
And blow the dust from your eyes and  
In the dark things happen faster.  
I love the way you sway your hips next to mine.  
  
I'm gonna get dressed for success  
Hitting a spot for the big time, baby.

Pour a little water and wash my pain away  
Leave me in the ocean of joy

You know that I do I'm drowning in you  
  
Take me to the tide of your heart  
Take me to the shore, babe and hold me close to you  
Leave me when the sky's getting dark  
Water from behind I can feel a fine line from you  
You know that I do I'm drowning in you  
  
Say hello, there's no goodbye  
If you can't read between the lines  
Found a love that I can't hide oh I've been drowning in your eyes  
Honey, honey, honey yea!  
  
Lead me to the gate of your dreams  
Put me on a ship that will sail the lovers' seas  
Water from the brooks and the streams  
Water in my face I can taste the ocean of you

With an absent-minded smile

Don't say a word  
All your thoughts must go un-heard  
And i......  
Have failed so many times....  
Entering your mind....  
Entering your mind....  
I'm not the most important one under the sun  
I don't have any power connections to the pentagon  
But I've got something of my own, that must get done

Every day he walks on by  
Life used to be so plain and simple  
Before he came into my life  
  
Every night I keep on dreaming  
Every night I take him home  
We always go to bed together  
I always wake up all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh it's strange, so strange  
What he's doing to me  
Oh it's strange so strange  
Did this ever happen to you  
The way it has happened to me  
The way it just happened to me  
  
Every day outside my window  
Always minutes close to eight  
I wish he stayed a little longer  
But his bus is never late  
  
Every night we're dancing slowly  
I play the music he adores  
Like Sinatra then we're talking  
All important things for sure  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh it's strange so strange  
What he's doing to me  
Oh so strange real strange

Over a thousand streets  
And you feel your heart

And you close your eyes  
Naked to the bone  
The dream comes alive  
  
Do you get excited  
When I touch you in the night?  
My oh my...  
Do you get excited  
When I meet you every night?  
You won't let the night pass you by  
  
When your body's hot  
The window's open wide  
This moment's all you got  
In this race of life  
  
When you feel the fire  
Is getting close to you  
Hey baby, you know  
I' m lonely too  
  
Do you get excited  
When I touch you in the night?  
My oh my...

"You're sliding down a dream, o yea.  
Where nights are born in blue, that's the truth.  
You're swimming in a stream, o yea.  
Fish are jumping too, next to you.  
  
Suddenly you notice someone's at the door,  
You could swear you've been through this all before.  
  
Then she runs her fingertips through your hair.  
Your life has just begun.  
Her fingers, they are everywhere.  
You're floating light like air,  
Leaving the ground and she shines on just like the sun.  
  
You're gazing at the sky, o my.  
The stars are out tonight, shining bright.  
You're waving to a cloud, bye-bye.  
You're drowning in the smile of his eyes.  
Suddenly you feel there's no time for a deal  
Though a voice tells you it's for real.  
  
And she runs her fingertips through your hair and life has just begun.  
Her fingers, there and everywhere.  
You're floating light like air, leaving the ground.  
She-she shines on just like the sun.  
  
It's just a sunny afternoon.  
Somebody's singing songs of love, child.  
You love a lazy afternoon once in a while.

"I once knew a girl  
I can't remember her name but I remember her face 'cause her sister looked the
same.  
  
They both left school, but they couldn't find a job  
So they said farewell and stole a small town car.  
  
As they were riding by the beach some summer night  
The radio shouted out one of those songs that might just change your life  
It went like this: ""Checkin' in checkin' out  
Making love I like watching all your fireworks  
I like it when I light those stars in your eyes  
Just like fireworks in the sky""  
Yes it did...  
  
Throwing some poems to the ports and docks  
They were sleeping outdoors pushing all their luck.  
  
They sent me a letter full of pills and thrills  
Then they both got rich and moved to Hollywood Hills.  
  
Yea they made lots of money playing folk guitar  
'Cause everywhere the boys went crazy just to hear these words of art:
""Checkin' in checkin' out  
Take it to the sky  
Making love I like watching all your fireworks  
I like it when I light those stars in your eyes  
Just like fireworks in the sky"".  
  
They're coming to get you  
They're coming to get you now  
Coming to get you now  
Watch the sky!

"I was alone  
I told my mouth to shot up 'cause I was talking to myself  
like I always do when I'm stuck  
Well, I was crying  
You could be crying too  
I was screaming throungh the windown, I keep missing you  
And the tears came down from the sky  
And the rain feel hard on my eyes  
  
Now you know what I look like, I'm feeling like a fool  
I lose on my own, I'm going back to school  
  
And I will pray, Hallelujah, you'll be breaking every rule  
and come back to stay, I'm feeling like a fool  
  
I really tried so hard to design my life  
There's a big black void in head like it's been cut by a knife  
Every time your name comes around this stupidity follows me down  
  
Now you know what I look like, I'm feeling like a fool  
I thought I could swim I'm drowning in the pool  
  
And I will pray, Hallelujah, you'll be breaking every rule  
and consider to stay, I'm feeling like a fool  
  
Please, come back to stay, I'm feeling like a fool  
I'm feeling like a fool in my heart  
I'm feeling like a fool

"First time, first love  
Oh what feeling is this  
Electricity flows  
With the very first kiss  
Like a break in the clouds  
And the first ray of sun  
I can feel it inside  
Something new has begun  
And it's taking control  
Of my body and mind  
It began when I heard I love you  
  
For the very first time  
For the very first time  
  
This life, this love  
All the sweetness I feel  
So mysterious yet  
So incredibly real  
It's an uncharted sea  
It's an unopened door  
But you gotta reach out  
And you gotta explore  
Even though you're not sure  
Till the moment arrives  
There he is and you know you're in love  
  
For the very first time  
For the very first time  
  
And baby when I met you  
Every feeling I had was new  
I don't think there are words  
To describe the sensation  
  
It's an uncharted sea  
It's an unopened door  
But you gotta reach out  
And you gotta explore  
And when something happens  
That words can't define  
Only then do you know you're in love  
  
For the very first time  
For the very first time  
For the very first time

"I knew the minute I saw you  
That we, we were two of a kind

I keep my love alive  
Yea, yea, yea!  
  
You go from head to toe  
This mystery has taken over me - I know  
You make the true love shine You go from head to toe  
There's all emotions flowing over me - I know  
You make the true love shine, eye to eye  
  
Well I've had a love that once blinded me  
But now it makes me wanna cry  
Well her heart is soaked with such cruelty  
Her 'hello' sure sounds like 'good-bye'  
  
But I keep my head up high  
I keep my love alive  
Yea, yea, yea!  
  
You go from head to toe...

"I've been hiding, lost in the love of another. I've followed the moon and a
song and I thought it would take me forever to find a place where I belong. I
watch a rainbow rise. I give you all i'v  
.  
  
I could never give you up, the way you make my love shine. I could never give
you up, the way you make true love shine.  
  
I believe you when you say you don't want to be lonely. I'll carry your heart
like a bridge when you need all the time you can find to get the hurt out of
your mind. I'll watch the rain go by an  
E you all I've got.  
  
Cause I could never give you up...

"There's a shadow on the terrace  
A snow dance for the living  
There's heavy weather on the way  
I heard it on the news.  
  
And life's a tough principal who won't reward the losers  
Your name is on the tea-cup  
There's nothing I can do.  
  
But to wish you'd think about me before you go to sleep  
And I wish you the best there is before you go to sleep.  
  
There are tears without the colour  
A million seas with water  
An ocean full of people where shattered hearts can go.  
  
And love's a golden ripple where answers are so simple  
But the explanations are very hard to do.  
  
And I wish you'd think about me before you go to sleep  
And I wish you the best there is before you go to sleep  
Go to sleep.

"Goodbye to you,  
Goodbye to broken hearts,  
Goodbye to romance,  
Hiding in the dark,  
  
Nights that leave a scar.  
Goodbye to you,  
Goodbye to empty cards,  
Goodbye to this ball of bliss,  
  
I'm dancing from your arms.  
And I fill the bedroom  
With silent visions of rain.  
And I paint the morning  
  
With echoes from pleasure in pain.  
I don't want to touch emotions,  
I just got to run away.  
Electric blue like oceans,  
  
Wild like lovers sway.  
Goodbye to you...  
And I seal the pillow  
And shatter dreams down the hall.  
  
And I hang the heartache  
Like pictures on the wall.  
Can you hear the sound of angels  
They're playing hurting games?  
  
Well, I'm a stranger when I'm leaving,  
I was a stranger when I came.  
Goodbye to you

"Daylight is breaking again.  
I hide in the dark.  
I'm watching the rain.  
You're out of touch.  
You're out of reach.  
What can I say,  
I never wanted it this way.  
  
Love sleeps all alone.  
The cold telephone,  
I know the heart.  
Yes, I know the kind.  
The kisses of fire, turning to grey.  
I never wanted it this way.  
I always wanted you to stay.  
  
Wash my pain away, cause I'm half a woman, half a shadow.  
  
Love always change with the trees,  
the spring and the leaves,  
the waves on the sea.  
Wilder than light the wind in your eyes led me astray.  
I never wanted it this way.  
I always wanted you to stay.  
  
Oh I need you, yes I need you.  
Give me a reason to believe.

"I'm in the phone booth it's the one across the hall.  
If you don't answer I'll just ring it off the wall.  
I know he's there but I just had to call.  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.  
I heard your mother now she's going out the door.  
Did she go to work or just go to the store?  
All those things she said I told you to ignore.  
Oh why can't we talk again?  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.  
It's good to hear your voice you know it's been so long.  
If I don't get your calls then everything goes wrong.  
I want to tell you something you've known all along.  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.  
I had to interrupt and stop this conversation.  
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation.  
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection.  
Oh I can't control myself!  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.  
Oh hang there unrelieved!

"When she walked up  
He walked down  
Just like the seasons went round and round  
She was in love  
He wasn't sure  
She wrote some letters he tried to ignore

So happy together  
They could have been  
So lucky in love  
Sing la dee da  
So happy together  
  
They could have run the earth, the sky, the sun  
She carried his ring  
Since she left school  
He knew she was precious  
The prettiest jewel  
She wanted a baby  
But he wasn't sure  
He couldn't make up his mind anymore  
  
They could have been  
So happy together  
They could have been  
So lucky in love  
Sing la dee da  
So happy together  
  
They could have run the earth, the stars, the sun  
I couldn't ever hurt no one  
If you feel shattered  
I'm sorry for what I've done  
We could have been  
So happy together  
  
We could have been  
So lucky in love  
Sing la dee da  
So happy together  
We could have run the earth, the sky , the sun  
Yeah we could have been  
So happy together  
  
We could have been  
So lucky in love  
So happy together  
We could have run the universe  
Could have run the universe  
Could have run the universe  
For fun  
So happy together  
So happy together  
So happy together

"Every shape of every word you say that breaks the silence of an ordinary day.  
Every look that seems to mystify, every single smile that spins me to the sky.  
It makes me want to run, it makes me want to hide.  
'Cause you're the only one that makes me come alive.  
It's getting closer now and darker by the hour.  
  
It only goes to show that here it comes,  
Here comes the weekend and I'm on my own again with a Saturday in the rain.  
Here it comes, here comes the weekend.  
The fine line from pleasure to pain is making me cry.  
When will I see you again?  
  
Every breath, every vision you make.  
Every chance in love you love to take.  
Every move that seems to alter my world.  
Every dream I've had about this boy and this girl.  
It makes me want to run, it makes me want to hide  
'Cause you're the only one that makes my love alive  
And time is running fast into a new goodbye.  
  
It only goes to show that here it comes,  
Here comes the weekend, another walk down that lonely lane,  
Another Sunday that feels the same.  
Here it comes, here comes the weekend.  
The fine line from pleasure to pain is making me cry.  
When will I see you again?

Get on up and kick it all the systems are ready to go.  
Well, are you ready or not? hey, I gotta know!  
  
Baby, lay down the blues and let those guitars bleed.  
I'm everything you wanted, I'm all you'll ever need.  
Cos I'm hotblooded, hotblooded,  
I need you lovin', I need your love so bad  
  
Flash all the lights, I'll be a camera tonight.  
I'll snap the look on your face when I'm squeezing you tight.  
Yea, sisters o'soul, we gotta burn this old house down.  
Keep on beatin' those drums, keep on pumpin' up that sound,  
yea yea yea yea yea  
  
Hotblooded,  
I'm hotblooded, I need your lovin',  
I need your love so bad.  
I'm hotblooded, hotblooded, you gotta know it,  
I need a shot of love so bad  
  
I stay up late where the night's alive.  
No sleep at all I work nine to five.  
It's honey do that and honey do this:  
""Can I call you home?""  
""Can I call you home?""  
""Can I call?"" - You can call me miss...  

"
"I see you comb your hair and gimme that grin  
It's making me spin now, spinnin' within  
Before I melt like snow, you say ""hello, how do you do!""  
I love the way you undress now, baby begin  
Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess  
I love your blue-eyed voice, like Tiny Tim shines through  
How do you do!  
Well here we are cracking jokes in the corner of our mouths  
And I feel like I'm laughing in a dream  
If I was young I could wait outside your school  
Cause your face is like the cover of a magazine  
  
How do you do, do you do, the things that you do  
No one I know could ever keep up with you  
How do you do, did it ever make sense to you  
To say bye, bye bye  
  
I see you in that chair with perfect skin  
Well how have you been baby, livin' in sin?  
Hey I gotta know, did you say hello, how do you do?  
Well here we are spending time in the louder part of town  
And it feels like everything's surreal  
When I get old I will wait outside your house  
Cause your hands have got the power meant to heal  
  
How do you do, do you do, the things that you do  
No one I know could ever keep up with you  
How do you do, did it ever make sense to you  
To say bye, bye bye  
  
How do you do, do you do, the things that you do  
No one I know could ever keep up with you  
How do you do, did it ever make sense to you  
To say bye, bye bye

"It's a madman's situation,  
Reminiscing in the rain,  
And I've lost your love again,  
I call your name.  
  
And I don't want to think about it  
When I go to sleep at night,  
Can you hear it in the wind?  
I call your name.  
  
I call your name...  
And I close the door behind me,  
I turn the lights all down,  
There's no-one there beside me,  
  
I call your name.  
And I don't want to think about it  
But I wind up all the same,  
Nothing'll ever change,  
  
I call your name.  
I call your name...  
Lie awake under the stars,  
Lie awake under the stars.  
  
I call your name...

"
"In everything I see you appear with me, how come? How come?  
And everything I do involves you too. We are like one.  
In my life there has been so many changes  
And I don't want to be left out in the rain  
  
I don't want to get hurt, I've done my time.  
All I want from you is to tell the truth.  
I don't want to get hurt no more this time.  
I don't want to go blind and find it's falling apart all the time  
  
In the middle of a dream you are there for me, your face, your lips.  
But there's no way you can tell 'cause I hide it really well, so well.  
In my life there has been loving and lying  
And I don't need another reason to cry  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to go blind and find I'm falling apart one more time.

"Mao Mao Mao...  
  
I love the sound of smashing guitars  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Red guitars against the wall  
Big guitars can turn so small  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Show it!  
  
The 6-string kick inside  
The 6-string kick inside  
The 6-string kick inside.  
  
I love the sound of breaking guitars  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Hey you long haired vintage Jesus  
Break the guitar into 1000 pieces  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Don't you?  
  
The 6-string kick inside  
The 6-string kick inside.  
  
Don't you love the sound of crashing guitars?  
Don't you love the sound of crashing electric guitars?  
Don't you love that sound, drivin' in your car  
Don't you love the sound of crashing electric guitars?  
Don't you?  
Don't you?  
  
I love the touch of watching the stars  
I love the sound of trashing guitars  
Custom made, Townshend's ace  
Smash the axe and break the case  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Crashing and crashing!  
  
The 6-string kick inside  
The 6-string kick inside.  
  
I love the sound of crashing guitars  
Mao Mao Mao...

"Are you ready? Go!  
I hear your footsteps like your walking.  
I hear your voice like your talking to me.  
I can reach every moment, every caress like I'm living a dream  
Down to the bone, go little darling.  
Oh I remember you, feels like it was yesterday.  
I remember you, you've got me running back again  
You shared my secrets and my laughter.  
I fell in love with the light in your eyes  
And I believed that summer would go on and on  
For the rest of my life  
Down to the bone...  
You've got me running.  
I say: na na na na na na na na na na.  

"
"It's no secret I've been waiting  
But I didn't expect this  
Nothing will remain  
Nothing stays the same  
After you came  
  
It's no secret I've been starving  
I never felt anything for years  
I sat up all night  
Just to watch your smile  
When you're sleeping  
  
I was so lucky you came by  
And turned a different corner  
I could've been somewhere else  
You could've passed by, could've passed by  
  
Come on and sail the sea with me  
Come on, let's go around the world  
Maybe find a flat  
Or a canyon house  
For the season  
  
I was so lucky you came by  
And turned a different corner  
It could've been someone else  
You had in mind  
I was so lucky you found me  
My rags turned gold and silver  
I could've been somewhere else  
You could've passed by, could've passed by  
  
What would you make of this, my baby?  
The sun through the trees  
Is there a better place to be?  
  
I was so lucky you came by  
And turned a different corner  
It could have been someone else  
You had in mind, oh my  
I was so lucky you picked me  
My trash turned to silver  
Yea, I could have been somewhere else  
You could've passed by, could'be passed by

"
"The first time we met time stood still  
You left me breathless  
Suddenly speechless.  
  
Within the hour we were one  
Two total strangers kissing the moonlight.  
  
Oh, you know I'm sorry I had to go  
I'm really sorry it had to die  
I'm really sorry I made you cry  
Cry.  
  
We fell in love between the nights  
Of too many lovers and too many teardrops.  
  
And fate won't resist some satin sheets  
I was so helpless  
Totally ruthless.  
  
Oh, you know I'm sorry I had to go  
I'm really sorry you're hurt inside  
I'm really sorry I made you cry  
Cry, cry.  
  
Love is lifting you up and draggin' you down  
Makes you go round and round and round  
Time makes a stop then it's all gone  
Funny how memories keep lingering on.

"
"Like a light coming down, from the sky  
Thundering venus and apollo  
And my invitation of the physical kind  
Out of control, I just tend to follow  
  
You're close to me, like the air that I breathe  
I touch too much, I never wanna leave  
  
Seems I'm under a magic spell (magic love)  
Any way I try, I just can't hide  
I'm under your magic spell (under a magic... )  
And nothing enough I'm on the hunt for your love  
  
Holding the fire out of the road  
Straight from the heart to the end of the rainbow  
Turning electric, and going for gold  
Body and soul, just has to follow  
  
You're close to me, like the air that I breathe  
I touch too much, I never wanna leave  
  
Seems I'm under a magic spell ...  
  
Baby for your love

"
"Can you tell me where it leaves  
When it's never ending?  
Can you tell me where to go  
When no one's home?  
  
Chorus:  
And I know, you know  
It hurts  
It hurts to be alone  
  
You're wrong, you're wrong  
On the one-way train going down  
Can you tell me what to say  
When there's no one listening?  
Can you show me what to do  
When all is done?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The plan has gone wrong  
Like a one-way train going down  
Going down, down, down  
Going down  
Going down, down, down  
Ooohhhh  
Yes I know, you know  
It hurts  
It hurts to be alone  
You're wrong, oh you're wrong  
On a one-way train going down, going down  
Going down, down, down  
Going down  
Going down, down, down  
That's the feeling  
It hurts to be alone  
Going down

"
"Lay a whisper on my pillow,  
leave the winter on the ground.  
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence  
in the bedroom and all around.  
  
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.  
  
It must have been love but it's over now.  
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.  
It must have been love but it's over now.  
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.  
  
Make-believing we're together,  
that I'm sheltered by your heart.  
But in and outside I've turned to water  
like a teardrop in your palm.  
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.  
  
It must have been love but it's over now,  
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.  
It must have been love but it's over now,  
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows  
it's where the wind blows  
  
It must have been love but it's over now,  
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.  
It must have been love but it's over now,  
it's where the water flows...  

"
"Why don't you take the rest of the day off  
You do deserve a break  
Follow that road, it ain't long  
Just cross that silver lake  
Yea, pass the pond, the off-white fence  
When you see the mailbox to the left you've made it all right,  
No way to go wrong  
All you do is blow that horn  
  
It takes you no time to get here  
Just drive out of town today  
It takes you no time to get here and when  
You've arrived you might as well stay  
You might as well stay  
  
Why don't you leave your desk for a short while  
You do deserve some time  
Enjoying the other side of life you forgot to memorize  
Stay in the sun, reach for the moon  
Make a little love in the afternoon  
You're doing all right, no way you go wrong  
This is the place where you belong  
  
It takes you no time  
No time to get here

"Got to grab a pen and a paper  
Got to write a tiny note to you,  
I can't get you out of my system

It's possible,  
When I get that feeling  
It's so revealing  
It's possible,  
When you're givin' that look  
I just wanna oh-oh-oh!  
  
People tell me all the wrong things  
People tell me I don't have a clue  
There's something in the air, I just know it!  
Like patches on the skin it stick like glue.

"Jefferson was always out of luck  
I remember when we both grew up  
Jefferson got hit by a westbound truck  
I guess that didn't make him look like a million bucks  
That night when Sally really stole the show  
And every boy was captured diggin' for gold  
Poor old Jefferson was left in the snow  
  
I'm gonna pray for Jefferson Pray for Jefferson's soul  
  
Jefferson is always on my mind  
When him and me were runnin' out of time  
Jefferson was sure enough left behind  
The cops came in and took him by surprise  
That night when Sally really showed her game  
The neighbourhood would never be the same  
Poor old Jefferson got the blame  
  
I'm gonna pray for Jefferson Pray for Jefferson's soul  
  
I do believe he didn't do wrong  
I say a prayer for someone I care for  
  
That night where Sally really gave it all  
And made us small boys look quite tall  
Poor old Jefferson left the ball

"You wake me up  
In the middle of the night  
And burn the cover down.  
You're on the phone in the air  
  
Like a record try to spin me around.  
Oh won't you move away,  
Oh honey get away.  
The joy of a toy,  
  
Is it all that you came for?  
The joy of a toy  
Got the look of a lie.  
The joy of a toy  
  
Put the hurt into action.  
The joy of a toy,  
You can kiss this love goodbye.  
How can you win  
  
When you don't know a thing  
What love is all about?  
Don't want to fight  
So get out of my sight  
  
I won't surrender now.  
It's independence day,  
Oh honey get away.  
The joy of a toy...  
  
Hello, goodbye...

"Hit the road out of nowhere, I had to jump my car  
and be a rider in the love game following the stars.  
don't need no book of wisdom, I get no money talk at all.  
She has a train going downtown, she's got a club on the moon  
and she's telling all her secrets in a wonderful balloon.  
  
Oh she's the heart of the funfair,  
she's got me whistling her private tune.  
And it all begins where it ends,  
and she's all mine, my magic friend  
  
She says: Hello, you fool, I love you.  
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride  
  
She's a flower, I can paint her, she's a child of the sun,  
we're a part of this together, could never turn around and run.  
Don't need no fortune teller  
to know where my lucky love belongs oh no.  
Cos it all begins again when it ends,  
and we're all magic friends  
  
She says: hello, you fool, I love you.  
C'mon join the joyride, be a joyrider  
  
I take you on a skyride,  
a feeling like you're spellbound.  
The sunshine is a lady  
who rox you like a baby.  
  
She says: hello, you fool, I love you.  
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride

"Didn't I tell you everything is possible  
In this deja vu?  
Try the river boat, the carousel,  
feed the pigeons, Barbeque.  
  
Look at all the people, happy faces all around  
Smiling, throwing kisses, busy making lazy sounds  
  
It's a bright June Afternoon, it never gets dark  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun  
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun  
  
Some folks are on blankets, slowly daydreaming  
And reaching for their food  
Let's go buy an ice-cream  
And a magazine with an attitude  
  
And put on a cassette, we can pretend that you're a star  
'Cause life's so very simple, just like la-la-la  
  
It's a bright June Afternoon, it never gets dark  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun  
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun, comes the sun  
  
There's a painter painting his masterpiece  
There's some squirrels jumping in the trees  
There's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon  
All my life I've longed for this afternoon  
  
It's a bright June Afternoon, it never gets dark  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun  
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun

"I hit the coast with the faith of a preacherman. I saw a ghost with a face
like a madman. I had this dream I was sleeping at the Royal Ball. I hit the
streets, hey watch me in the monitor! I saw a clone who looked just like a
senator. I checked the clock, I felt that it was time to go go go.  
  
Then came you.  
  
Why did you keep me waiting so long?  
Why did you keep me waiting so long?  
Why did you keep me waiting so long?  
  
I was a spy, I was captured by the enemies. I made a million selling secret
fantasies. I saw my love wasted in a pale grey zone. I was the quake shaking
every monument. I had to fi-find out what all the money meant. I checked the
sun, I knew that it was time to go go go.  
  
Then came you...

"Hey now honey  
You got to face the floor  
You headed for the heart  
But you couldn't find the door, could you?  
Could you?  
  
Well, I'm standing in the sun  
But I'm living in the rain  
I got to get a-whirlin' like a human hurricane over you  
Over you  
  
Now you're looking like a fox on the run  
And you're faster than a shot from a gun  
I'm pointing at you, oh you  
Talking 'bout you, hey you  
  
I thought we had love in store  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
Babe, I've seen it all before  
You keep on knockin' on every door  
Ain't no lovin' you ignore

Keep keep knock knockin' on every door  
You keep on knockin' on every door

Time is all you've spent  
You moved into the bed  
But you couldn't pay the rent, could you?  
Could you?  
  
In the twinkle of an eye  
You electrify  
I got to get a-shootin' like a rocket in the sky, bye bye  
Goodbye  
  
Now you're burning like you're hot on the scene  
Don't you love to steal a part of my dream?  
I'm looking at you, oh you  
Talking 'bout you, yea you  
  
I thought we had love in store

You keep on knockin' on every door  
Ain't no sugar you ignore

And hold it close to you,

The cold and lonely nights,  
Just take this heart I'm giving  
And love is on the rise.

Want to hold you through the night,  
Like lovers do  
And when I look into your eyes,  
  
Like lovers do  
Oh I'm drowning in an ocean of emotion.  
It feels just like forever  
Since I made love to you,  
  
September days of scarlet,  
April morning dew.  
So take the love between us  
And hold it close to you,  
  
I want us to get together  
Like lovers do

"I know there's something in the wake of your smile.  
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea.  
You've built a love but that love falls apart.  
Your little piece of heaven turns to grey.  
  
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you.  
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do.  
  
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why,  
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.  
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile.  
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea.  
They're swept away and nothing is what is seems,  
The feeling of belonging to your dreams.  
  
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you.  
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do.  
  
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why,  
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.  
And there are voices that want to be heard.  
So much to mention but you can't find the words.  
The sense of magic, the beauty that's been  
When love was wilder than the wind.  
  
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you.  
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do.  
  
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why,  
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.  
  
Listen to your heart when he's calling for you.  
Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do.  
  
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why,  
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.

"Once upon a time there was a little girl  
Once she was mine  
In my heart the only one  
I wonder where you are  
I know you're somewhere in me  
I can see your smile when I close, close my eyes  
  
Oh little girl  
Where did you go, little girl  
I miss you so  
Oh, I remember when she was mine  
I remember when she was mine  
  
Once upon a time there was a little voice  
Singing loud and clear  
In my heart the only one  
Once upon a time there were so many dreams  
Once they were mine  
Oh little girl, they're with, oh they're with you now  
  
Oh little girl  
Where did you go, little girl  
I miss you so  
I remember when she was mine  
Oh, I remember when she was mine

"She had those magic eyes you could see from miles around  
She wore her summer dresses bright  
Quite like the sky  
She always came in colors  
All smiles in daffodils  
She let her hair down in the breeze  
  
But every little thing has changed today, little Miss Sorrow  
Every little thing turned pale and faded, little Miss Sorrow  
The sunlight doesn't show  
Although the colors go  
Out through the window  
  
She used to go out dancing  
Cool silver fingernails  
I used to watch her from the bar  
Following her car  
She always came in colors  
She always kept control  
She painted yesterday in gold  
  
But every little thing turned grey today, little Miss Sorrow  
Every little thing turned pale and faded, little Miss Sorrow  
The sunlight doesn't show  
All the colors go  
Even the rainbow  
  
Allow me to introduce myself  
I'm just a local boy  
She was my little Miss Joy  
I want to call her name  
My life won't be the same  
Dear God  
  
Every little thing has changed today, little Miss Sorrow  
Every little thing turned pale and faded, little Miss Sorrow  
Yes, every little thing turned grey today, little Miss Sorrow  
The weakling plays the strong  
The bird forgot the song  
What's going on?  
What's going on?  
Tell me what's going on?  
What's going on?  
What's going on?  
Tell me what's going on?

"Where did she go?  
Where did she go from here?  
The last time I saw her  
she made all the clouds disappear  
She said, with a smile,  
yea, the weather's alright  
She left her coat at home that night  
  
Where do I begin today?  
Where do colours never fade?  
In the sunshine, in the rain  
it's quite the same  
It's never gonna change  
I'll be looking for Jane  
  
Why did she come?  
Why did she come to me?  
There must have been millions  
in the world she'd rather see  
At least in my mind  
as time has gone by  
it's always harder to laugh then to cry  
  
Where do I begin today? (ba-ba-ba)  
Where the colours never fade (ba-ba-ba)  
In the sun and in the rain  
it's quite the same  
It's never gonna change  
I'll be looking for Jane  
  
Where do I begin today? (ba-ba-ba)

"Hold back the night  
I wonder what she's doing when she's not in sight  
I wonder where she's going who she holds tonight  
I wonder if she's sleeping alone  
  
And hold back the pain  
I cover up the teardrops in the pouring rain  
My heart has been run over by a runaway train  
I wonder if she's ever alone  
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!  
  
Her love spins like a merry-go-round  
Going up and down, she's far away bound  
Her love - expression of vision and sound  
It's setting me up, and then it's kicking me down  
  
Don't fade to gray,  
I wonder if she's ever coming back to stay  
She's running on the edge she hit the harder way  
I wonder if she's only a dream  
  
So hold back the night,  
I wonder what she's doing when she's not in sight  
I wonder where she's going who she holds tonight  
I wonder if she's lost in a dream  
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!  
  
Her love spins...

"I don't know much about you, but I pretty sure I want to be with you  
I haven't got a clue what is wrong, what is right, what is left to do  
I read a magazine  
I watch a TV-screen  
I dive into a dream only to find me in love with you  
  
I wish you'll never stop to make my head go pop  
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop  
every time you're around  
  
It's a pleasant valley Sunday and everything seems to be beautiful  
People go to church, but I'm found contemplating by the swimmingpool  
I'm gazing at the sun  
I watch him bringing joy to everyone  
I feed the ducks with a ban only to find me in love with you  
  
I wish you'll never stop to make my head go pop  
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop  
  
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop  
every time you're around  
Press to play and never stop to make my head go pop  
Yea, you make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop every time you're around  
  
Make my head go pop pop pop  
Make my head go pop pop  
Go pop pop  
I feed the ducks with a ban only to find me in love with you

The only one who knows the story  
  
Do you want to talk about it? - I don't know  
Do you want to say some words? - Oh, I can't let go  
I'm talking about my world, my love, my life  
Everytime I try to close my eyes  
you just enter my mind  
and you lay yourself down beside me... oh why?  
  
Some streets are covered with sweat  
there are no regrets just new connections... oh why?  
You are the Summer Son and i'm the one who wants affection

"You build it up and tear it down, there's no reason to follow you.  
You left the song without a sound, you left the story I made for you.  
Softly angels bow and cry in the stillness of the night.  
  
Never is a long time - goodbye.  
No answers for the asking.  
It's a long time - goodbye.  
No mercy for the aching.  
It's a long time - oh I see no light on the forsaken.  
Never is a long time - goodbye.  
Let's spend the night when this dream has come to an end.  
  
Sometimes you laugh,  
Sometimes you cry, and yes,  
I've cried over you.  
You've left me blind in paradise.  
You've left me hungering for the touch of you.  
Snow white angels run and hide in the blackness of the night.

The senses together,  
Four-leafed and clever

You're one in a million,  
We're two of a kind.  
  
It's you that I long for,  
It's you that I hunger,  
Oh you are the maker of waves in my mind.  
We dance in the moonlight,  
  
A run on the wire,  
Drawing a fine line,  
A neverending love.  
The fever turns slowly into a fire,  
  
Drawing a fine line,  
A neverending love.  
Chasing your shadow,  
Moon and the water,  
  
Field and the reaper,  
Star and the sky.  
Chasing your shadow,  
Hammer and heartbeat,  
  
Clay and new concrete,  
I follow the signs.

You take it all for granted  
You wake up every morning  
And expect to rise  
Have you ever had a moment  
To look into the mirror  
To find a person  
Who won't open her eyes  
Have you ever felt a presence  
(Or is it all in the past, dear?)  
So mesmerizing  
It chills you to the bone  
Have you ever been in love  
And overcome that first fear  
Well, then you know  
No one makes it on her own  
  
Did you ever catch a sunset  
Right across the ocean  
The universe revealed  
And it didn't make sense at all  
When you came into my world  
Causing quite a commotion  
I could have sworn I've met you  
Many times before  
Cos there's something in your eyes  
That links us together  
Something 'bout your face your lips  
Your smile looks so alone  
Have you ever been in love  
And thought it'd last forever  
Well, then you know

Leave you here, never let you down.

And the temple we built stayed sacred and free  
I came looking for more self-esteem  
All I found was your voice on the answering machine  
Simple and clear  
  
Some might say it's truthful gone  
I don't believe them

"There was a banquet of believers when we walked into the room.  
December days of X-mas felt like days in June.  
And there were morning light and sunrise chimes ecoed all around.  
Now's the time for weary minds, the moon is northern bound.  
  
And you know I'm going back, going back today.  
Back to where I came from.  
And you know I'm going back, going back to stay.  
To the alleys where pearls of passion came my way.  
  
There's a promise in the twilight, it's so innocent and wild.  
Two hearts that break the silence, you can hear a distant cry.  
And there's emptiness and loneliness, it's more or less the same.  
Let's run between the raindrops, babe and catch the midnight train.

There's no escape for the broken-hearted, there's no return once you've lost  
your way.  
I say a prayer now our love's departed that you'll come back to stay and bring  
the perfect day  
Blinded by a crazy light I fell into the darkest night.  
Those magic ties, the two of us, I couldn't see it turn to dust  
Hey now, it seems you've always reached me like the sun.

She's gonna run run run 'cos here you go and break her heart.  
She's gonna run run run before you start to tear it apart.  
Go! Go!  
Fire in your eyes, a new love is burning.  
Go! Go!  
But she's not gonna be there when it comes to returning.  
Go! Go!  
She's dreaming alone in this lonely world.  
Go! Go!  
You give all you got to another girl.  
She's gonna run run run 'cos here you go and break her heart.  
She's gonna run run run before you start to tear it apart.

"Baby, sometimes I feel like dying  
Driving while I'm closing my eyes  
Moving in and out of hiding  
Trying to catch some thruth in my life  
Wathing your stars and your moonlight  
Come tumbling down from the sky  
Take it now.  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
I wanna find you  
In everything that I do  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna count on you  
I'm gonna follow  
Baby, what else can I do?  
  
Sunday morning my town is sleeping  
Lying all alone in my bed  
There's not a sound, I can't help but listening  
Wishing I was somewhere else instead  
But sometimes they are too hard to handle  
Those voices inside my head  
Listen now.  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
I wanna find you  
In everything that I do  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna count on you  
I'm gonna follow  
Baby, what else can I do?  
  
Take a walk inside my dream: A church, a lonely road  
All the people come and go and come and go.  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
Do it now!  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
I'm gonna follow  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
I wanna find you  
In everything that I do  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna count on you  
I'm gonna follow  
Baby, what else can I do?  
  
I'm gonna run to you  
I'm gonna come to you  
Baby, what else can I do?

"I can barely remember my past  
Everything seems to disappear so fast  
But I recall being jealous and alone  
Gazing at the dreams going by  
  
I started my life when you knocked on the door  
Found something inside I didn't dare to ignore  
Now I do believe in flowers on the moon  
I'll swim beside the golden tide  
  
You crashed by the gate  
Captured my fate  
Salvation  
My eyes couldn't see  
I hardly breathed  
I was diving so deep  
Salvation  
  
I'm down in the study holding on to my luck  
Will you still love me when I call you up?  
I gave you my body, the power over me  
Come on, bring out the best in me  
  
You crashed by the gate  
Captured my fate  
Salvation  
My eyes couldn't see  
I hardly breathed  
My heart was asleep  
Salvation  
Some will get broken  
Others will get lucky like me meeting you  
Don't pass me by  
  
You crashed by the gate  
Captured my fate  
Salvation  
My eyes couldn't see  
I hardly breathed  
I was down on my knees  
Salvation  
Some will get broken  
Others will get lucky like me meeting you  
Don't pass me by  
Don't pass me by  
  
I found salvation, oh yea  
You bring me salvation  
I found salvation

"I move all right,  
I got the wheels going round,  
Making ways in the night.  
Yea we're movin' all right,  
  
Wipin' the rain from the ground  
And the pale from the sky  
But something happens in his heart  
When the morning comes  
  
The secrets that she keeps away from me,  
The tears on the pillow  
She don't want me to see,  
Well every little thing she does is for me  
  
But somebody new is breaking us in two.  
He's the kind of love  
That makes a whirl in your mind,  
Like the tide and the time.  
  
With just a little bit o'soul  
He fights to find peace of mind  
In these shattering eyes  
But something happens in his heart  
  
When the morning comes.  
The secrets that she keeps away from me...  
The secrets that she keeps away from me.  
The love of you and me...

"Don't ever say you do  
Don't ever say you want to make me shine  
You keep your mystery, don't ever try  
To be my guiding light  
Mmm...  
  
Don't ever say you care  
Don't follow when I'm here and everywhere  
I'm blinded by your looks but there's a scent  
Of heartache in the air  
In the air...  
Hey you!  
Walk out through that door  
And into that dream  
Where I met you before  
Oh oh...  
  
Babe, you seduce me  
You take my heart and use me  
My feelings all run wild  
When you seduce me all the time  
  
Don't ever call me up  
I never wanna hear your voice again  
Oh lay your pretty hands on someone else  
Somebody who don't know you well  
Know you well...  
  
Hey you!  
Your sweet sweet talk can't stay  
And get back to that dream  
Let's both keep it that way  
Hey hey...  
  
Oh you seduce me  
You pull my heart and use me  
And I keep running blind  
When you seduce me all the time  
Mmmm... get back to that dream  
Let's both keep it that way  
Hey hey...  
Tell me once again...  
  
You seduce me  
You take my heart and use me  
My feelings all run wild  
When you seduce me all the time  
When you seduce me all the time  
You seduce me all the time  
You seduce me...

"With the moon and the sun in his eyes  
He's arriving  
And I don't know what I'd do without him  
I got life suddenly  
  
See, see me  
I've got nothing to hide  
See me  
I've got nothing to hide  
See me  
  
I'm leaving my heart in the palm of his hand  
So gently  
I know he knows that I love him  
Though I've never said is there an easy way  
  
See, see me  
I've got nothing to hide  
See me  
I've got nothing to hide  
See me  
  
Coming home  
I'm coming home  
It feels like I'm coming home  
Coming home  
I'm coming home  
  
See, see me  
I've got nothing to hide  
See me I've got nothing to hide  
See, see me

"I heard your heart, you held it close to me.  
The wild embrace, the silent sea,  
A whisper of imagery for Lovers Supreme.  
But now I'm lost in the crowd,  
No shadow of a doubt  
It's all over now,  
No shadow of a doubt.  
You changed the dream.  
You changed the scenery,  
the tender touch, the urge to breathe,  
There under a lovelit sun  
What's lost could be found.  
But now, no trace of a sound,  
no shadow of a doubt.  
I'm faraway bound.  
No shadow of a doubt.

"We grew up together,  
we've been here forever.  
Barefoot in the summer,  
cold in stormy weather.  
She taught me all there is,  
like magic and love,  
lots of forgotten words.  
  
But now,  
she doesn't live here anymore.  
She's off and she's gone,  
she doesn't live here anymore.  
I'm sorry that's all there is to it,  
I'm sorry that's all.  
  
She dressed just like a painter,  
a female street Picasso and I,  
I will remember the heaven in her laughter.  
And the scent of her sweet perfume  
when we made love under an August moon  
  
But now,  
she doesn't live here anymore.  
She's off and she's gone,  
she doesn't live here anymore.  
I'm sorry that's all there is to it,  
I'm sorry that's all.  
  
But now, she doesn't live here anymore.  
She's off and she's gone,  
she doesn't live here anymore  
She's gone since long, so long,  
she doesn't live here anymore.  
She took off and left home,  
She doesn't live here anymore.  
I'm sorry that's all there is to it,  
I'm sorry that's all.  
That's all.

"What she got she got to give it to somebody  
What she got she got to give it to someone  
It's not a case of growin' up or lots of money  
It's just the fundamental twist of the sun  
  
What she got she got to let somebody find it (""Really?"")  
What she got is not for her to keep alone (""Oh!"")  
Nobody's got a clue if there is such a reason (""Yeah?"")  
Why she wanna play it o-on her own  
  
She's got nothing on but the radio  
She's a passion play  
And like the break of day  
She takes my breath away  
  
What she got she got to give to some contender  
What she got is just like gold dust on a shelf  
And no one's got a clue what's on her brave agenda  
Why she wanna keep it keep it to herself  
  
She's got nothing on but the radio  
It's a passion play  
And like the break of day  
She takes my breath away  
  
Who did the painting on my wall?  
Who left a poem down the hall?  
Oh I don't understand at all, he-he-hey

I don't know where we're going.  
I wrap my arms around your naked shoulders,  
take cover for the night.  
I see you in the morning rain,  
oh step inside and lay beside me.  
Tender can you close my eyes and blind me,  
oh give me just a smile...  
  
Before I fade to silver,  
Silver Blue for you.  
Before I fade to silver,  
Silver Blue for you  
  
I've turned into The Broken One  
who lost the inspiration.  
I want to give you all my love  
like water to a blood red rose.  
The Passion, I can't deal with her.  
The Pain, well I can do without him.  
And this is like the milky way,  
an ocean that only grows and grows

night shopping for a soul to go.  
  
I'm sitting on the top of the world and I like it.  
I'm sitting on the top of the world, I want this to be real.  
  
Coming out of my cage, made of steal,  
God I know, it's final.  
Decided to release my love on vinyl.  
Those little things you show, you kissed the wind, you let it blow.  
  
I'm sitting on the top of the world and I like it.  
I'm sitting on the top of the world and I like it.  
I'm sitting on the top of the world and I like it, and I like it.  
  
Flip right through a magazine, bottle neck, a tambourine.  
Light a candle at the show swinging high and low.  
  
I'm watching the dawning  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
And I like it  
I'm sitting on top of the world

your mind. Sleeping single - I will wait for you 'til time has gone by.  
  
I'll pay the price for all the love you poured like rain ""toujours l'amour""
over again, but the midnight chills are getting so rough and the bed is big

"It's not the chapters he reads  
When you're feeling low down.  
It's not the touch of his skin  
When you kiss him goodnight.  
It's not the money he spends  
When you want to buy a daydream  
And not that miracle smile  
That makes the sky bright.  
  
It's not the way his hands behave  
When you've turned out the light.  
  
It's the small small small talk that makes it all happen.  
Small small small talk that makes you want to fly,  
Yes it does.  
  
It's not the way he believes  
In you like a religion.  
It's not the thrill that you get  
When he's holding you tight.  
  
It's not the way his eyes persuade  
You to stay the night.  
  
It's the small small small talk that makes it all happen  
(Just like that)  
Small small small talk that makes you feel like flying,  
Yes it does.  
  
Information, heart and soul, a whisper, a word,  
Confessions that have to be heard.  
Small small talk, small small talk.  
  
Come on now, come on now, come on -  
You make it rock so heavenly.  
  
Come on now, come on now, come on -  
You seem to talk so heavenly.

Darkness all around my heart.  
I was alone but didn't fear  
To wander in the light of stars.  
  
In the bright and silent night,  
Winds would knock and disappear.  
Still I felt the feeling near,  
Like the first time you were ever here.  
  
You're so far away,  
So far away,  
You left me,  
You told me you would stay.  
  
You never said goodbye  
And I'll keep asking why,  
I keep on asking how,  
Oh come unto me now.  
  
I have breathed the morning air,  
I have heard the four winds blow.  
I was weary but prepared to follow  
Down this lonely road.  
  
In the room where lovers sleep,  
Winds would knock and disappear.  
Still I felt the music near,  
Like the first time we were ever here.  
  
You're so far away,  
So far away,  
You left me,  
You told me you would stay.  
  
You never said goodbye  
And I keep wondering why,  
I keep on wondering how,  
Oh come inside me now.

Hey, life will go on  
Time will make sure will get over you  
This silly game of love you play you win only to lose  
  
Spending my time  
Watching the days go by  
Feeling so small

Oriental! Hey-Ho! She's gonna be there climbing the stair.  
Flag waving up in the air.  
She's gonna be there, jungle somewhere...  
And Boy - Take your eyes away from her.  
And Boy - Lay them on another girl.  
She's a Teaser Japanese.  
She's a Teaser Japanese.  
She's a Teaser Japanese.  
And Boy - You're gonna get burned Queen of Arts!  
Hey-Ho! Eyes of black meet eyes of blue.  
Beast and Beauty, wave goodbye.  
Sayonara Moon up in the sky.  
And Boy - Take your eyes away from her...  
(in Japanese) I wish to say many things -  
But you are not here.  
I want to ask you a lot -  
But you are not here.  
You promised to be back soon,  
Was it only to comfort me?  
I do want to see you again  
And Boy - Take your eyes away from her...  
(in Japanese)  
I beg you to return to me

"She's the top, she's got the world on a string.  
She makes me boogie, makes me do anything  
yea yea. -  
Hey now, touch the sky,

Well, she's a miracle, she's all that I need

Hey now, reach the sky,

And I know what love can do.  
Yes I know what hearts can do  
  
The big love is taking the wheel,  
the big love goes head over heels,  
the big lust, bring it into the small world,  
the bigger, the better.  
Big love, waiting to catch the big one,  
head over heels, the big one,  
bring it into the small world.  
I'm building the big big love,  
I'm building the big big love  
  
It's kinda strange, a bit mysterious,  
I gotta take it oh so so serious. -  
Hey now, touch the sky,  
you've got a certain kind of look in your eyes.  
  
It used to be hard, so lonely at night,  
well, she's my baby and I'm feeling alright. -  
Hey now, move the sky,  
there's a certain kind of look in that smile.  
  
When I'm making love with her.  
When I'm making love to her yea.  
  
It has to be a big thing  
It's bringing me to my knees  
Has to be a big thing  
Big thing  
  
Ya know what I'm saying...

"She was the first girl on the moon  
She didn't compromise  
When she took off that cold afternoon  
Heading for the northern skies.  
  
I told her I could come  
That I could come along.  
  
She was the first girl on the moon  
I think I was her only friend  
She brought her raygun, an old harpoon  
Just in case of accidents.  
  
I told her I could come  
That I could come along  
But she didn't let me come along  
Wave goodbye  
Wave goodbye.  
  
She was the first girl on the moon  
Standing tall, flag in hand  
She looked around humming a tune  
The strangest song known to man.  
  
I told her I could come  
That I could come along  
But she never let me come along  
Wave goodbye. Wave goodbye.

"Babe it's time to tell me that it's over, tell me that it's over, it's plain
to see. And this time we won't be starting over, no crying on your shoulder
into the heart shaped sea. Oh you've been a-running from our door and you've
been enchanted by the gracious voice of love.  
  
Babe it's time to look me in the eyes, time to say goodbye, it's clear to me.
And this time I won't let you down, you can turn around, I'll set you free. Oh
you've been a-sailing from our shore and you've been enchanted by someone from
afar.  
  
Babe it's time to gather all the harvest, to pray before the winter and sail
the heart shaped sea. Oh you've been a-running from my love and you've been
enchanted by the powers up above.

"I was raised the northern way  
And my father had a northern name,  
I did my crying out in the pouring rain.  
And a season turned into another one,  
I found a heart bright like the morning sun.  
He touched my lips, so softly, with his fingertips.  
  
But I kept the rain  
Falling down on me  
All the time, all the time.  
I kept the rain  
Falling down on me  
All the time, all the time.  
  
And some things in life won't ever change,  
There's a smell of a rusty chain  
And of love disappearing like an aeroplane.  
I've kept the rain  
Falling down on me  
All the time, all the time.  
I've kept the rain  
Falling down on me  
All the time, all the time, all of the time.

"Red like fire was the day I met you  
I tell you now, there are no regrets  
In this room there are many memories  
Some are good, some I try to forget  
  
I thought we were the chosen ones  
Who were supposed to fly  
  
We're very much the same, you and I  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye  
Still waiting to get hurt, time after time  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye  
When love lies in our hands we seem to run and hide  
And I can't help but wonder why  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye  
  
My heart was like a runaway train, babe  
I don't believe I've ever felt more alive  
In this room I hear voices linger  
We never talked about the pride  
  
You know you're not the only one  
Who knows how to cry  
  
We're very much the same, you and I  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye  
Still waiting to get hurt, time after time  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye  
When love lies in our hands we run away and hide  
And I can't help but wonder why  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye

"
"Between the open heart and the whisper goodbye  
There's a perfect teardrop in your eye  
Between the lover's moon and the trembling sky  
There's a broken dream in your mind  
  
And the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark  
  
Between the careful touch and the breakaway kiss  
There's a beauty you can't resist  
Mmm, between the fall apart and the moment of bliss  
There must be something more than this  
  
And the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
Love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark  
In the dark  
Hear the lonely voice  
Hear the lonely voice  
  
And the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
Love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark  
  
Oh, yea, the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
Love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark. In the dark  
Lonely voice. Lonely voice in the dark  
Hear the lonely voice  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark...

"Sunday morning  
I'm still hiding in bed  
Listening to the rhythm of the rain above my head  
And all that I have said  
I sure saved a lot for you  
But what could I do?  
If I'd been talking to the wall  
It wouldn't make any difference to you  
That's the art of being you  
  
I think I carry the weight of the world  
Sometimes you lose  
The weight of the world  
Sometimes you cry  
  
I kiss your smile  
I wish you'd stay the night  
I put my arms around your golden head and turn out the light  
Oh I love to watch your eyes  
When I make love to you  
Wait little world  
Sometimes you lose  
  
The weight of the world  
Sometimes you cry  
Sometimes you cry  
  
The weight of the world  
Sometimes you lose  
The weight of the world  
Sometimes you cry  
Sometimes you cry

"Lay it down, pull my heart to the ground,  
Time's getting cold now the leaves all turn hard and blue  
And I know when I gaze to the sun, no place to hide  
I got nowhere to run from you, away from you  
  
Hold me now,  
girl, I don't know when,  
when we will ever meet again.  
That was then,  
baby, this is now,  
I try to get over you.  
Losing you...  
Things will never be the same.  
Can you hear me call your name?  
If we changed it back again  
things would never be...  
  
In your hand,  
babe, I don't understand,  
you've got the eyes of a child  
but you hurt like a man  
always do, always do.  
Touch me now, girl,  
I don't when,  
when we will ever meet again.  
That was then,  
baby, this is now,  
time won't get over you.  
Losing you...  
Things will never be the same.  
Can you hear me call your name?  
If we changed it back again  
things would never be...

"Turn to me - when your heart breaks away  
Turn to me - don't turn me away  
When everything's sad and down  
When you're looking for somewhere to run  
  
Why don't you turn to me?  
Turn to me  
Why don't you turn to me?  
Turn to me  
Turn to me - when the moon gets to go  
Turn to me - when the story's been told  
When everything's dim and grey  
And you're hitting a rainbow way  
  
Why don't you turn to me?  
Turn to me  
Why don't you turn to me?  
Turn to me  
  
Now that Christmas is here  
A shadow of fears  
And if you want to seek ....  
Turn to me and read these lonely lonely eyes  
  
Why don't you?  
Why don't you turn to me?  
Turn to me!

"Raging waves sweep this heavy heart.  
Cold is the colour of the dark.  
Find a byway and climb that hill,  
Watch the thunder cast a spell.  
What did you gain from love?  
Don't ask me!  
All for the sweetest thrill...  
  
I see a view from a hill - oh oh.  
I see it perfectly clear and I cry for the dreams that you kill  
Oh oh, view from a hill, and it's only a moment away.  
  
Love is a rainfall, hard on the head,  
No escape though you're soaking wet.  
Leave me blinded by your light.  
Leave me stranded alone tonight.  
What did you gain from love?  
Don't ask me!  
All for the cheapest thrill...  
  
I see a view from a hill -- oh oh.  
I see it perfectly clear and I cry for the dreams that you kill -- oh oh,  
View from a hill, and it's only a motion away.

"I knew this would happen  
And I don't want to be around  
When it gets out.  
I've closed the last picture  
  
And painted the windows  
Inside and out.  
Give me your dreams  
And I'll give you my time,  
  
Together we'll cross the borderline.  
Voices -  
Cracking the night,  
Voices -  
  
That cut like a knife,  
Voices -  
Hear them singing...  
From sparks to the fire,  
  
From here to obsession they cover the end.  
Twisting a match  
And see the reflections of hunters of men.  
Give me your dreams  
  
And I'll give you my time,  
Until we make it to the borderline.  
Voices...

"Everywhere I look I see her smile  
Her absent-minded eyes  
And she has kept me wondering for so long  
How this thing could go wrong  
It seems to me that we are both the same  
Playing the same game  
But as darkness falls this true love falls apart  
Into a riddle of her heart.  
  
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands  
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand  
I could never hurt (""the one"" alternately with ""someone"") I love  
She's all I've got  
But she's so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable  
  
Days like these no one should be alone  
No heart should hide away  
Her touch is gently conquering my mind  
There's nothing words can say  
She's colored all the secrets of my soul  
I've whispered all my dreams  
But just as nightime falls this vision falls apart  
Into a riddle of her heart, yea  
  
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands  
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand  
I could never hurt the one I love  
She's all I've got  
But she's so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable  
  
Don't hide your eyes...  
  
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands  
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand  
I could never hurt someone I love  
She's all I've got  
But she's so vulnerable  
Oh so vulnerable

To clean my soul

The day you left me  
The day you came  
I'll never forget you  
Feel you in my pain

The time was flying

I'm not dying

I'm waiting for a new day  
I'm waiting for the night

I'm waiting for the dark

I'll always miss  
I'll never forget

Ending up nowhere at all.  
Can't see the sun on my wall.  
Going through emotions.  
Ending up on a frozen morning  
With a heart not even broken.  
  
Seems I've been running all my life, all my life.  
Seems I've been running all my life, all my life, all my life  
  
Like watercolors in the rain.  
  
Find a place to settle down.  
Get a job in a city nearby  
And watch the trains roll on by.  
I'll find the falling star.  
I'll fall in love with the eyes of a dreamer  
And a dream worth believing.  
  
Seems I've been running all my life, all my life.  
Seems I've been running all my life, all my life, all my life.

"Halfway through the night  
I wake up in a dream  
Echoes in my head  
Make every whisper turn into a scream  
  
I dreamed I could fly  
Out in the blue  
Over this town  
Following you  
Over the trees  
Subways and cars  
I'd try to find out  
Who you really are  
  
In the middle of the night  
Cool sweatin' in my bed  
Got the windows open wide  
Thinkin' about all the things you said  
  
I wish I could fly  
Out in the blue  
Over this town  
Following you  
I'd fly over rooftops  
The great boulevards  
To try to find out  
Who you really are  
Who you really are  
  
I wish I could fly now  
Wish I could fly now  
Wish I could fly now  
  
I wish I could fly  
Around and around  
Over this town  
The dirt on the ground  
I'd follow your course  
Of doors left ajar  
To try to find out  
Who you really are  
  
To try to find out  
Who you really are

Watch you sink like a stone  
You can't put your arms around what's already gone  
  
Well, you hurt to the core  
You used to kiss like no one had done before  
And your taste turned me on  
Now you drive me real crazy just by being born

How did this old bed fit a world between me and you.  
We said ""Goodnight"" but the silence was so thick  
You could cut it with a knife.  
We've hit the wall again and there's nothin' I can do.  
You're the one, yea, I've put all my trust in your hands.  
C'mon and look in my eyes, here I am, here I am  
  
You don't understand me, my baby.  
You don't seem to know that I need you so much.  
You don't understand me, my feelings,  
The reason I'm breathin', my love  
  
The mornin' comes and you're reaching out for me  
Just like everything's the same  
And I let myself believe things are gonna change.  
When you kiss my mouth and you hold my body close,  
Do you wonder who's inside?  
Maybe there's no way we could feel each other's pain.  
Tell me why it gets harder to know where I stand.  
I guess loneliness found a new friend, here I am  
  
You don't understand me  
  
You don't seem to get me, my baby.  
You don't really see that I live for your touch.  
You don't understand me, my dreams or the things I believe in, my love.  
You don't understand me. You don't understand me. Understand me.

"I wake up in a different daylight  
Guess I haven't been around

Naked like water - shining like honey  
Move me - You turn me on - The thrill of it all  
You turn me on - The thrill of it all  
You turn me on - The thrill of it all  
  
I read in the paper how everything's changed  
But it's all the same - it's out of the game  
I reach out and touch an endless temptation Live in a dream - the strangest
sensation  
Move me - You turn me on...  
  
The lines I have written are the lines on your face  
They merge out of nowhere - and leave with no trace  
And I've had the feeling we're turnin' to one  
When everything's said - when everything's done  
Move me - You turn me on...  
  
You move me - Oh, baby, turn me on
